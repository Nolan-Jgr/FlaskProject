This is a personal project to better understand the use of flask, python, front-end languages, etc.
This project is based on a the lego games and how those games have a "free play" option to each level, and this program simulates that.
I took characters from three games(Lego Star Wars, Lego DC Villains, and Lego Marvel Superheros.
After selection the game of choice, the charcter slots will be filled with random characters.
